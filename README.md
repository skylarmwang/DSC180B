## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/skylarmwang/DSC180B/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Introduction and Context

People are highly opinionated beings and the power of social media to influence public opinion is an important area of study. We often have strong opinions of some topics and malleable ones of others, however, there is always room for change. Many external experiences, events, or factors can have an influence on opinion. One such factor is the intake of information from the different social media platforms that exist today. The existence of opinionated messages about any topic all over the internet and the ease of its accessibility can result in a shift in public opinion over time.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/skylarmwang/DSC180B/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
